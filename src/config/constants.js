    title: 'How much should you tip your movers?',
    desc: 'The standard tipping rate for professional movers is between £3 and £6 per hour for each mover. On average, people set aside around 20% of their total budget to tip their movers. Tipping doesn’t usually cost more than 20% of the total cost of the move unless, of course, you’re an extremely generous tipper.Point to note: You should always tip everyone the same amount of money per hour, be it the movers or the lead workers. Unequal tipping can lead to dissatisfaction amongst the crew members. With GetMovers, making more money in tips should depend more on the number of hours worked and not the position worked.',

For people who don’t know how to operate a tow truck, calling in a professional moving agency or a dedicated automobile transport service is the best decision at hand.',

Pianos weigh around 340 kilograms (750 pounds), which quickly puts them out of the lifting range of most families. Combine that with the fact that pianos have a super delicate balance of hammers, strings, and interconnected keys, which can get all messed up or broken easily, and you got yourself the ultimate nightmare of moving a pianoProfessionals, who are used to dealing with pianos, aren’t just strong people, they’re also highly familiar with the musical instrument and its know-how.',

    title: 'Pottery and Art',
    desc: 'The difficulty of moving pottery or art goes without saying. The average pottery piece can break or crack at a slight drop or mishandling. On the other hand, art forms, such as paintings, might not seem as breakable, but they are much more prone to damage from other factors such as heat, light or smudging.Furthermore, dealing with such pieces often means handling an object that is simply not replaceable, for instance, a family heirloom. Hence, pottery or art of any kind must be handled very carefully on every step of the moving journey from the initial wrap to the final unloading.',

Furthermore, all movers (or participants if it’s a DIY move) should be informed beforehand about the presence of the firearms to be relocated.The removal and storage of firearms can also be deemed illegal under certain circumstances. When planning a move, be sure to educate yourself on the gun safety and relocation laws of the intended location before making a move.',
